- 👋 Hi, I’m @Abaddon1971
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many things...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Information Systems at Concordia University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on class projects. So I am selective.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Those who do not know how, will never learn. Thos that do are a select few.
